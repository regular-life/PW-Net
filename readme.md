This is the repository for the paper *"Towards Interpretable Deep Reinforcement Learning with Human-Friendly Prototypes"*[^1].

The paper was published with a spotlight presentation at ICLR 2023, Kigali, Rwanda, see paper [here](https://openreview.net/forum?id=hWwY_Jq0xsN).

The paper proposes a "wrapper" component which can be added to any pre-trained agent to make it interpretable-by-design. Specifically, the original agent $f_{enc}$ is used as an encoder, which produces an output $z$. This representation is then transformed by going through multiple different MLP networks $h_{i,j}$ which then assess its similarity to pre-defined human-interpretable prototypes $p_{i,j}$ for common concepts used in the domain. For example, in the figure above, common concepts used in driving are "right turn", "left turn", "accelerate", and "brake". So, we defined these *a-priori* alongside the output weight matrix $W'$, which together form an interpretable design for the agent.

In the above figure for example, the agent sees its current state $S$ as being most similar to the prototypes for "turning left" and and "accelerating", so the similarity function outputs a high value for these, which then produces the final output action.

This repo uses a lot of the code from Jain (2022)[^2], from which we use the pre-trained agent for the Car Racing domain.

### Car Racing

To reproduce these results for the Car Racing Domain Simply copy the whole repo and run these commands in the terminal whilst in the "Car Racing" directory:

```
python3 -m venv pwnet
source pwnet/bin/activate
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip install toml
pip install numpy
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install gym'[box2d]'
pip install tqdm
pip install gym==0.24.0
pip install gym-notices==0.0.7
pip install scikit-learn
```

Then run

```
Python collect_data.py
```

When you have the collected data you can now train the various wrappers. Simply run...

```
Python run_kmeans.py
Python run_pwnet*.py
Python run_pwnet.py
```

And the terminal will print off the results, reproducing the results for Car Racing from the paper.

### Atari Pong

For the Atari Pong repeat the above process for car racing, but this time install this environment:

```
python3 -m venv pwnet
source pwnet/bin/activate
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip install gym==0.21.0  
pip install opencv-python
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install atari-py==0.2.9
pip install gym'[atari]'
pip install gym'[accept-rom-license]'
pip install scikit-learn
pip install toml
```

The code in this directory is heavily based upon Şentürk (2020)[^3]

------------------------



## To-do List
1. Make package for easier usage.
